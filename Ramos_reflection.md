**Reflection GPS 1**

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    
    I was confused about the process that happens when you fetch and merge back into your local repo after someone else made changes

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - I only understood abstractly *merge conflict*, but didn't know what were the consequences and what happened after
    - Pulling (fetch + merge) to your local repo
 
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - About best practices to name branches and files
    - About commands I didn't remember and if the position (directory or branch) I was in had an impact in the commands I was using
 
4. What still confuses you about Git?
    
    I think this was very helpful, and for now all my questions have been answered!
    
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

    I really liked it! I was nervous about the idea of a guided exercise, but once it started, I felt very confortable. It was great being able to ask questions in the spot and learning about best practices.
